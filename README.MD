# PranaDB

PranaDB is a distributed streaming database, built from the ground out to be horizontally scalable.

Like relational databases? Like Apache Kafka? PranaDB lives at the intersection of the two.

* Ingest data from Apache Kafka topics
* Define continuously and incrementally updating materialized views over that data.
* Use standard SQL to query that data.
* Define custom processors to process that data
* Stream data directly into and out of PranaDB

Think:

* Like Kafka but where you can query the data in your topics
* Like a relational database, but where you can get incrementally updating materialized views, and streaming queries.
  Take your pick.
