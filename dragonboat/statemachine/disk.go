// IOnDiskStateMachine is the interface to be implemented by application's
// state machine when the state machine state is always persisted on disks.
// IOnDiskStateMachine basically matches the state machine type described
// in the section 5.2 of the Raft thesis.
//
// For IOnDiskStateMachine types, concurrent access to the state machine is
// supported. An IOnDiskStateMachine type allows its Update method to be
// concurrently invoked when there are ongoing calls to the Lookup or the
// SaveSnapshot method. Lookup is also allowed when the RecoverFromSnapshot or
// the Close methods are being invoked. Invocations to the Update, Sync,
// PrepareSnapshot, RecoverFromSnapshot and Close methods are guarded by the
// system to ensure mutual exclusion.
//
// Once created, the Open method is immediately invoked to open and use the
// persisted state on disk to continue from the persisted state. This makes
// IOnDiskStateMachine quite different from the IStateMachine types which
// require the state machine state to be fully reconstructed from saved
// snapshots and Raft Log entries.
//
// As IOnDiskStateMachine always has most of its state kept on disk by design.
// Its SaveSnapshot method is thus only invoked on demand when a full snapshot
// is required to be streamed to a remote node.
//
// Applications that implement IOnDiskStateMachine are recommended to setup
// periodic snapshotting with relatively short time intervals, that triggers
// the state machine's metadata, usually only a few KBytes each, to be
// periodically snapshotted and thus causes negligible overheads for the system.
// It also provides opportunities for the system to signal Raft Log compactions
// to free up disk spaces.

	// Open opens the existing on disk state machine to be used or it creates a
	// new state machine with empty state if it does not exist. Open returns the
	// most recent index value of the Raft log that has been persisted, or it
	// returns 0 when the state machine is a new one.
	//
	// The provided read only chan struct{} channel is used to notify the Open
	// method that the node has been stopped and the Open method can choose to
	// abort by returning an ErrOpenStopped error.
	//
	// Open is called shortly after the Raft node is started. The Update method
	// and the Lookup method will not be called before the completion of the Open
	// method.

	// Update updates the IOnDiskStateMachine instance. The input Entry slice
	// is a list of continuous proposed and committed commands from clients, they
	// are provided together as a batch so the IOnDiskStateMachine implementation
	// can choose to batch them and apply together to hide latency. Update returns
	// the input entry slice with the Result field of all its members set.
	//
	// The read only Index field of each input Entry instance is the Raft log
	// index of each entry, it is IOnDiskStateMachine's responsibility to
	// atomically persist the Index value together with the corresponding state
	// update.
	//
	// The Update method can choose to synchronize all of its in-core state with
	// that on disk. This can minimize the number of committed Raft entries that
	// need to be re-applied after reboot. Update is also allowed to postpone such
	// synchronization until the Sync method is invoked, this approach produces
	// higher throughput during fault free running at the cost that some of the
	// most recent Raft entries not synchronized onto disks will have to be
	// re-applied after reboot.
	//
	// When the Update method does not synchronize its in-core state with that on
	// disk, the implementation must ensure that after a reboot there is no
	// applied entry in the State Machine more recent than any entry that was
	// lost during reboot. For example, consider a state machine with 3 applied
	// entries, let's assume their index values to be 1, 2 and 3. Once they have
	// been applied into the state machine without synchronizing the in-core state
	// with that on disk, it is okay to lose the data associated with the applied
	// entry 3, but it is strictly forbidden to have the data associated with the
	// applied entry 3 available in the state machine while the one with index
	// value 2 got lost during reboot.
	//
	// The Update method must be deterministic, meaning given the same initial
	// state of IOnDiskStateMachine and the same input sequence, it should reach
	// to the same updated state and outputs the same results. The input entry
	// slice should be the only input to this method. Reading from the system
	// clock, random number generator or other similar external data sources will
	// violate the deterministic requirement of the Update method.
	//
	// Concurrent call to the Lookup method and the SaveSnapshot method is allowed
	// when the state machine is being updated by the Update method.
	//
	// The IOnDiskStateMachine implementation should not keep a reference to the
	// input entry slice after return.

	// result.
	//
	// When an error is returned by the Lookup method, the error will be passed
	// to the caller of NodeHost's ReadLocalNode() or SyncRead() methods to be
	// handled. A typical scenario for returning an error is that the state
	// machine has already been closed or aborted from a RecoverFromSnapshot
	// procedure before Lookup is handled. You implementation is expected to
	// panic when there is any unrecoverable error during Lookup.
