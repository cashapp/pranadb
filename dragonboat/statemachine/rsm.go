Package statemachine contains the definitions of the IStateMachine and
IOnDiskStateMachine interfaces to be implemented by application state machine
types.

IStateMachine or IOnDiskStateMachine are the interfaces used by Dragonboat to
interact with applications. Each IStateMachine or IOnDiskStateMachine instance
is associated with a single Raft node replica from a certain Raft group. All
update requests, known as proposals, are arranged by the Raft protocol into a
Raft Log, once a proposal is accepted by the majority of member Raft nodes, it
is considered as committed. Committed proposals are passed to the Update method
of the IStateMachine or IOnDiskStateMachine types to be applied into application
state machines. Read only queries will eventually hit the Lookup method to query
the state of the state machine. The PrepareSnapshot, SaveSnapshot and
RecoverFromSnapshot methods are for generating and restoring from snapshots,
snapshots are the mechanism to apply the entire state of a state machine without
applying an arbitrarily large number of Raft Log entries.

Dragonboat users should first determine whether the application state machine
should implement the IStateMachine or IOnDiskStateMachine interface -

For in memory state machines which in general have low read/write latencies and
relatively small amount of managed data, IStateMachine is usually employed. It
is the default type of state machine described by the Raft thesis. The major
drawback is that each IStateMachine is internally guarded by a sync.RWMutex so
read/write accesses are not allowed to be concurrently invoked on IStateMachine.
Multiple read requests can be concurrently invoked on the same IStateMachine
instance. As the state is in-memory, it needs to be reconstructed from saved
Snapshots and Raft Logs after each reboot. The state is usually perioidically
snapshotted to disks. CPU, disk bandwidth and disk space overheads are thus
introduced for generating and storing such periodic snapshots.

For IOnDiskStateMachine based application state machine, the major difference is
that the state machine state is persisted on disk so it can survive reboot
without reconstruction from saved snapshots and Raft Logs. As the state is
mostly persisted on disk by design, there is no need to periodically save the
entire state to disk again as full snapshots. A full snapshot is only generated
and streamed to a remote node from the leader on demand when the remote node is
significantly behind the progress of its leader. Read and Write accesses can be
concurrently invoked on IOnDiskStateMachine types. This allows the Lookup method
to be concurrently invoked when the state machine is being updated. The Update
method can also be completed when SaveSnapshot is being executed. It is up to
the user implementation to correctly and safely maintain its internal data
structures during such concurrent accesses. IOnDiskStateMachine is basically the
on disk state machine type described in the section 5.2 of the Raft thesis.

When you are not sure whether to use IStateMachine or IOnDiskStateMachine in
your project, the rule of thumb is to implement IStateMachine first and upgrade
it to an IOnDiskStateMachine later when necessary.

IConcurrentStateMachine is another supported state machine interface, it aims to
represent in memory state machine with concurrent read and write capabilities.
